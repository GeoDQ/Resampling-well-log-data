# Resampling-well-log-data

Well logs often do not have consistent depth values, due to different sampling spacing. Thus cannot directly be used for data analysis such correlation, regression and classification.
In this notebook I show how to resample the well data and create a well log dataset where all the logs share the same depth values.
